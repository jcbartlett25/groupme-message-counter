# groupme-message-counter

## Where can I find this?

* https://groupme-message-counter.herokuapp.com

## What is this?

* This application allows you to see the total number of messages each person in a GroupMe group has sent. Using the secure GroupMe API, the webapp quickly parses a groupchat's history and counts the messages.

## Why did I make this?

* I really only made this app to prove a point to a friend who accused me of being the least active person in one of our message groups (looking at you Knox).
